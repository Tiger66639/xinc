<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2><a name="WhatXincIs"></a>What Xinc Is</h2>

<p> Xinc is a continuous integration server. Its main purpose is to integrate the development work
of multiple developers upon each commit. Xinc listens to the changes of a source control repository such as subversion and triggers
different build scripts if a change is detected. After building the project, Xinc reacts on the result
of the build. Depending on whether the build was successful or failed it triggers special publishing scripts,
which can deploy software, send notification emails or create deliverables. </p>

<h2><a name="HowXincWorks"></a>How Xinc Works</h2>
<p>Xinc runs as a daemon process in the background processing multiple projects.
The projects itself are defined in xml and make use of tasks (defined in Plugins) to run the build process.</p>
